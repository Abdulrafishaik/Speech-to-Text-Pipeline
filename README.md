🎙️ #Speech-to-Text Transcription App with Noise Reduction

This project demonstrates a speech-to-text transcription system using OpenAI's Whisper model along with noise reduction, all accessible through a Streamlit web interface.

🚀 #Features

   Upload .mp3 or .wav audio files
   
   Transcription using OpenAI Whisper (base model)
   
   Built-in noise reduction using noisereduce
   
   Returns timestamps with transcribed text
   
   Streamlit app for user-friendly interface
   
   Ready to run in local or cloud environments like Google Colab

🛠️ #Requirements

   Python 3.7+
   
   streamlit
   
   Whisper
   
   noisereduce
   
   soundfile
   
   pyngrok (optional for Colab deployment)

   #How It Works
   
   Upload your audio file via Streamlit interface.
   
   The app applies noise reduction to clean the audio.
   
   OpenAI Whisper transcribes the audio with timestamps.
   
   The result is displayed in the browser.
